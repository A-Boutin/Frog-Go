# Frog-Go
A stylized recreation of the Go board game. This recreation attempts to make the game feel like you're playing with your grandfather. Grandparents tend to teach, cheat, and make conversations with you as you play. This is trying to recreate that.

You are fighting against your frog grandfather who attempts to teach you the game. The twist is that you can additionally "cheat" by placing extra stones you should not be able to and by picking up pieces you should not be allowed to as well. You must try to cheat without getting caught by your grandfather and you must also keep an eye out for the possibility of your grandfather cheating.

## Playing The Game

You can play the game of Go with all of its intended rules and mechanics. After you place your stone, your grandfather will then place his stone after a short amount of time.

### Capturing Pieces

Capturing pieces happens the same as in the original game of Go.

### Cheating

If you do not wait for your grandfather and instead decide to place a second stone, the game will let you. This is cheating, and is not allowed in the actual game of Go. This is a feature of this version of the game. This can be used to gain an advantage in a losing scenario, but be careful that you are not caught!
